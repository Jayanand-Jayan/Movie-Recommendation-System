# Movie-Recommendation-System

There are three main types of Recommender Systems based on their basic idea of recommendations:
<ul>
  <li>Demographic Filtering</li>
  <li>Content Based Filtering</li>
  <li>Collaborative Filtering</li>
</ul>

In this notebook, I implement Collaborative Filtering.
Collaborative Filtering is usually implemented using methods like clustering, nearest neighbours (KNN), and matrix factorization (SVD). However, with the evolution of Deep Learning in the recent years, the use of the same has seen a rise in Recommender Systems. I have used Neural Collaborative Filtering in this notebook to implement such a Recommender System.
